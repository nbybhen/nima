# nima
CLI for running "quick" calculations on the fly (aka via terminal).

Main goals are to give me an opportunity to develop my mathematical skills [and learn a new language on the side :).](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html)

## Example Usage (TODO)
```bash
# Builds project
nimble run

# Run CLI
./nima [category] --[operation]

# Runs unit tests
nimble test
```
